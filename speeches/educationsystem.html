  <h2><strong>Redefining Success</strong></h2>
  <br><br>

<p>Albert Einstein once said, &ldquo;Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing it is stupid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yet our education system judges students by the same narrow standards, and this has become the reality for many today, leaving them to believe that they are incapable. I, as a student, feel like a fish that is being judged by its ability to climb a tree.</p>

<p>We are judged by our report cards, our grades define our success, and if we don&rsquo;t measure up, they tell us we&rsquo;ve failed.</p>

<p>Let me ask you. What's the first thing that comes to your mind when I say the word &lsquo;success&rsquo;?</p>

<p>The truth is that success varies from person to person; it's not a one-size-fits-all. For me, having constantly moved between the Indian and British education systems, success has meant adapting, growing, and proving that I can thrive despite constant change. For others, it may mean excelling in sport, music, leadership, or innovation. Yet, in school, success is defined almost exclusively by grades &mdash; a single letter on a report card that supposedly sums up our entire potential.</p>

<p>But does it really?</p>

<p>You see, education is necessary, but school itself wouldn't get you very far. Let's face it, Students are being trained to work like robots running factories: lined up in straight rows, raising their hands to speak, given a short time to eat, and for eight hours a day, they're told exactly what to think. After all that, most of us end up with 9-5 mediocre jobs, working under someone else, where our voices are silenced, talents are wasted, and potential is overlooked. No matter how we define success, the traditional education system is failing to prepare us for it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This system, designed during the Industrial Revolution, was never meant to foster creativity, critical thinking, or innovation. It was built to train factory workers, to create obedience and routine. And while society has evolved, the education system has not. And at the heart of this outdated system lies one of the biggest culprits: grades.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So you see, I'm not against education; I'm against <em>the system</em>, the standard that's being set for us. It is a place where each kid is taught that spending mindless hours chasing A&rsquo;s is the only way to prove their intellect. That isn't hard work when it's just like running a race where the only goal isn&rsquo;t to understand but to memorise, or even worse, an eating buffet where you have to force yourself to download information, and the ones who can vomit the most information get rewarded with a paper certificate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Intelligence, creativity, innovation &mdash; these cannot be reduced to letters of the alphabet. To define them so narrowly is to limit them.</p>

<p>And this isn&rsquo;t just my frustration. When I asked other students what they thought needed to change, the answers were strikingly similar. They didn&rsquo;t ask for shortcuts or easier exams. They asked for an education that values creativity as much as calculation, individuality as much as uniformity, and freedom as much as discipline. Their voices revealed a common truth: this system is failing not just me, but an entire generation.</p>

<p>Teen suicide is now one of the leading causes of death among young people. This is a stark indicator that the pressures placed on students &mdash; from grades, expectations, and a system that prioritises conformity over wellbeing &mdash; have real and devastating consequences. These are not abstract numbers; they are a warning that the education system is failing to protect the mental health and potential of its students.</p>

<p>All it is is an education malpractice, where one teacher stands in front of 30 kids, each with their own needs, gifts, and dreams, yet they&nbsp;are all taught the same thing in the same way. We tell them, &ldquo;This is what you must learn. This is how you must behave. This is who you must become.&rdquo; And when they don&rsquo;t measure up, we tell them they&rsquo;ve failed. Did you know that Thomas Edison failed more than 10000 times before he finally invented the light bulb and in response to a question about his missteps, he responded &ldquo;I have not failed 10,000 times&mdash;I&rsquo;ve successfully found 10,000 ways that will not work.&rdquo; and this fact can be applied to anyone yet here if we score low on an exam we are labeled as good for nothing. Horrific, isn't it?&nbsp;</p>

<p>And the teachers aren't the ones to blame; they're just doing their best in a system that is already broken. A system that values conformity over creativity, memorization over innovation, and obedience over original thought</p>

<p>What if, instead of punishing weaknesses, the system celebrated strengths? What if every child could walk out of school with not just a grade, but confidence in their unique abilities?</p>

<p>There are already examples that prove it&rsquo;s possible. Look at Finland&rsquo;s education system: shorter school days, less standardized testing, and more emphasis on collaboration, creativity, and problem-solving. Students are encouraged to be independent thinkers, not just passive recipients of information. And it&rsquo;s working&mdash;Finland consistently ranks among the top countries in educational outcomes. If they can do it, so can we.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>So the real question is: If they can do it, why can&rsquo;t we?</em></p>

<p>Students might be 20% of the population right now, but they are 100% of the future, our future. So, ladies and gentlemen, let's come together and make a difference. Let&rsquo;s break free and create a world where every child is free to discover their own potential, where grades don&rsquo;t define their worth, and where their unique gifts are celebrated, a world where fish are no longer forced to climb trees.</p>
