  <h2><strong>Until our voices are no longer a threat</strong></h2>
  
<p>A girl in Sudan was five years old when it happened. Her grandmother held her legs. Her aunt brought the blade. And when she screamed, they said she was dishonouring the family.</p>

<p>What kind of a world do we live in where a girl's first memory of her body is pain?</p>

<p>A lot of you have misunderstood feminism. It isn't about hating men, it's a political movement, a resistance standing up for the unjust acts made against women every single day, A scream in a world that's spent centuries silencing women.. Where is our voice? They say feminism is outdated now just because women can vote, wear trousers and climb the corporate ladder--if they're lucky.</p>

<p>They say we have freedom. But freedom shouldn't come with conditions.</p>
<p>You can be hear--<em>if you're polite</em>.</p>
<p>You can lead--<em>if you don't intimidate</em>.</p>
<p>You can exist--<em>if you make everyone else comfortable.</em></p>
<p>That's not freedom. That's a leash.</p>

<p>We still live in a world where a woman speaks and she's "too emotional," ; but a man screams and he's "assertive." Where a girl's body is still a battlefield for men's power plays-- from catcalls on the street to mutilation in the name of purity. Where girls are raised to apologise before they speak--"Sorry, can I just--?" Sorry for existing? Sorry for breathing? Sorry for daring to have a voice?</p>

<p>You want to talk about barbarism? You want to talk about oppression? Let me ask you this: how can we be equal when girls are still being sewn shut? In the name of tradition; no anesthesia, no choice--just a blade, some string, and a lifetime of silence. Girls as young as five are tortured with the most brutal form of female genital mutilation: infibulation. They're having their labias cut, genitals sewn up with thorns, left with nothing but a hole the size of a matchstick, for urine and for blood. Not for pleasure, not for choice, not for freedom, and we&rsquo;re speaking about body autonomy here but millions of girls bleed alone in silence, others simply die. And if they manage to survive, then they're married off as kids only to have their bodies torn open on the wedding night like a ritual, because we&rsquo;re not seen as human, just pleasure dolls, bodies to be broken, used, and discarded. Over 230 million girls and women alive today have undergone FGM, primarily in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East; about 4.4 million girls risk it annually, averaging&nbsp;<em>12,200 girls every. single. day.</em></p>

<p>In some countries, they mutilate us. In others, they sell perfection in bottles and silence us with makeup ads and beauty standards. In both, we are not ours.</p>

<p>All this, and we're the ones told to be grateful, to be grateful for getting to walk into boardrooms, grateful we aren't burned off like witches. Grateful for what? because females are still told "stay safe" or "don't wear this" instead of teaching men "keep your eyes to yourself". Females are still having to clutch their keys between their fingers as a weapon and text their friends "I'm home safe" as a survival mantra and when we speak up? We are overreacting, we are "man-hating".</p>

<p>We are still told to shrink ourselves, to lower our voices, not to talk back. Since birth, every woman is taught to be a shadow, to be small, to be a nobody. no voice, no opinion, no choice, yet people preach "speak up for what's right", "get yourself out of uncomfortable situations". How, when we are raised to think we aren't even allowed to exist loudly?</p>

<p>We are not man-hating if we demand safety, if we refuse to smile through injustice. But this isn't just about bad men or broken traditions.</p>

<p>It's about systems--legal, political, religious--that reward silence and punish resistance</p>

<p>And the second we ask for more--more respect, more safety, more humanity--we're told we're too much. Too loud. Too angry.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Be angry.</p>
<p>Be too much.</p>
<p>Be the girl who won't shut up.</p>
<p>Be the woman who ruins the "vibe"</p>
<p>Be the voice that makes the whole room shift in discomfort</p>
<p>Because silence hasn't protected us.</p>
<p>It's only protected them.</p>
<p>Only <strong>14% of films</strong> in the past decade were directed by women.</p>
<p>We can't even tell our stories--because we don't hold the camera.</p>
<p>But we will.</p>
<p>We will hold the pen.</p>
<p>We will hold the mic.</p>
<p>We will hold power.</p>
<p>We are the revolution you can't stop</p>
<p>Because this isn't about being liked.</p>
<p>This is about being heard.</p>
<p>And we will not whisper anymore.</p>
<p>Because until no girl is mutilated in silence,</p>
<p>Until no woman is punished for speaking,</p>
<p>Until our voices are no longer a threat,</p>
<p>Feminism will never be over.</p>
<p>And neither will we.</p>
